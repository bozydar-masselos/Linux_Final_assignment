Input data are not included in repo, in my pc the file is in pwc/input_data/exonNuc.fa.gz location

In file "how to run" you can see the commands I used to execute the different scripts.

In folder Report you can find a txt where I have written all the results requested by Jasons' "Introduction_to_Linux_Assignment" PDF.

In config and envs I have written what I thought necessary as input data for my mainscript.sh and dependencies for the dockerfile respectively. I didn't create the actual dockerfile.
