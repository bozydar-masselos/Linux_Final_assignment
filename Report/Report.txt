Chat GPT explanation...
Here‚Äôs a summary of each gene‚Äôs function and evolutionary conservation:  

### 1) **CAMK1G (Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase 1G)**  
   - **Function**: CAMK1G is a member of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) family, which plays a role in various cellular processes such as neuronal signaling, synaptic plasticity, and gene expression regulation. It is involved in phosphorylating target proteins in response to calcium influx.  
   - **Evolutionary Conservation**: CAMK1G is conserved in vertebrates, particularly in mammals and birds, indicating its fundamental role in calcium signaling. Orthologs exist in various species, but sequence divergence is seen in invertebrates.

### 2) **STL7L (Suppression of Tumorigenicity 7 Like)**  
   - **Function**: The STL7L gene is poorly characterized, but it is related to the ST7 (Suppression of Tumorigenicity 7) family, which has been implicated in tumor suppression. ST7 is known to play a role in cell adhesion and signaling.  
   - **Evolutionary Conservation**: STL7L has homologs in mammals, but its evolutionary conservation is less well studied compared to ST7. Its function in tumorigenesis suggests it may be subject to selective pressures in higher vertebrates.

### 3) **SCYL3 (SCY1-Like Pseudokinase 3)**  
   - **Function**: SCYL3 belongs to the SCY1-like family of pseudokinases. While it lacks catalytic activity, it is thought to play a role in intracellular trafficking and protein sorting, particularly in the Golgi apparatus.  
   - **Evolutionary Conservation**: SCYL3 is conserved in vertebrates, with homologs found in fish, birds, and mammals. It likely evolved from an ancestral kinase but lost its catalytic function over time.

### 4) **FMO3 (Flavin-Containing Monooxygenase 3)**  
   - **Function**: FMO3 is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of xenobiotics, including drugs and dietary compounds. It plays a crucial role in detoxification and metabolism of nitrogen-containing compounds, such as trimethylamine. Deficiency in FMO3 leads to trimethylaminuria ("fish odor syndrome").  
   - **Evolutionary Conservation**: Highly conserved in mammals and other vertebrates, FMO3 belongs to the broader flavin-containing monooxygenase family, which dates back to early metazoans.

### 5) **NCDN (Neurochondrin)**  
   - **Function**: Neurochondrin is involved in synaptic plasticity, neuronal development, and signaling pathways. It plays a role in learning, memory, and possibly neuropsychiatric disorders.  
   - **Evolutionary Conservation**: Highly conserved in vertebrates, particularly in mammals. Its role in neural function suggests strong selective pressure to maintain its function across species.

### 6)  FMO1 encodes a flavin-containing monooxygenase, an enzyme that plays a key role in the oxidation of xenobiotics ‚Äî foreign substances such as drugs, pesticides, and dietary compounds. Specifically, FMO1:
Catalyzes the N- and S-oxidation of soft nucleophilic heteroatom-containing molecules.Is involved in drug metabolism, working alongside cytochrome P450 enzymes but typically acting on different substrates. Works using FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide) as a cofactor and NADPH as an electron donor. Is active mainly in the kidneys and fetal liver in humans, but not highly expressed in adult human liver (unlike other FMO isoforms).

	-Evolutionary conservation: FMO1 is evolutionarily conserved across mammals, indicating its important biological role. The FMO gene family (FMO1‚ÄìFMO5 in humans) evolved through gene duplication, and each member has somewhat specialized substrate specificities and tissue distributions. Some FMOs have diverged more than others; FMO1 remains relatively conserved, especially in its active site motifs and catalytic function.

Things I learned from chat GPT feedback on my code:

For mainscript.sh 
One of my functions (gooe()) is too complex and it is advised to break it down to smaller functions.
I am trying to handle errors by exiting is specific steps which is good, but I couldn't have writtern a function dedicated to error handling, which would point more specifically to the issues that caused the errors.
I have a few redundant export commands

For vaptish.sh

I haven't created the conditions for robust input and output directory handling and recognisiion, my script is very prone to user mistakes. 
I learned that <ls|wc -l> also counts hidden files so it can lead to sum different than expected. It is better to use <find> instead of <ls> to count files. 

For q1trees.sh 

 Unnecessary || true in iqtree2 Command
I have piped iqtree result to true because the program was stopping when
there were not enough data to create the trees. So these erros were stoping my script from creating rest of the trees. Maybe I need to make another system to handle these errors of iqtree2. 

Once again my ipnut and output directory handling is mediocre and could cause issues. My script doesn't check if one directory, the input dir exists, before running next lines of the program.

Discussion: 

Most loci, whether exon or complete CDS appear to to be highly conserved among the species included in our alignment. Thus, in the second case 
where we search into the properties of the 5 phylogenies that are either most similar or least similar to the concatenated alignment, the 
two groups of genes, appear, as long as ChatGPT info are true, to be all highly conserved between the taxa analyzed. I think that the most interesting
element of this analysis is the fact that the 5 exons with least distance from the concatenated alignment belong to genes different than the 5 CDS with least distance. This difference highlights the different analytical resolution achieve by analyzing single exon sites versus complete CDS.
