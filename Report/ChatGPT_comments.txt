General Feedback:

Your script is well-structured and follows good practices, such as using set -e for error handling, logging messages, and defining modular functions. However, there are some potential issues and areas for improvement:

    Error Handling:

        Instead of using exit 1 everywhere, consider defining a dedicated error_exit function for cleaner error messages and optional debugging output.

        The download_data function calls error 1, but error is undefined. It should be exit 1.

    Logging Issues:

        The end_message function uses trap "mv ./log.txt ./exit_log.txt" EXIT, which will overwrite exit_log.txt every time the script runs. Instead, append a timestamp to avoid losing previous logs.

        The export log_file=./log.txt inside end_message is redundant.

    Portability & Compatibility:

        zless is assumed to be available, but it is not installed by default in many environments. Consider using zcat instead:

    zcat "${inputdata}" | while read x;

    head --lines=1 can be replaced with head -n 1 for broader compatibility.

Code Structure Issues:

    The gooe function is quite complex; refactoring the nested loops into helper functions would improve readability.

    Instead of local STOP=$((cntr + c )), consider renaming STOP to next_exon_index for clarity.

Unnecessary export Statements:

    Some variables (e.g., Final_output_dir) do not need to be exported unless accessed by subprocesses.

### **General Feedback**
Your script is simple and serves the purpose of renaming files and modifying FASTA headers. However, there are some **issues and limitations**:

#### **1. Error Handling and Robustness**
- The script assumes that `ls ./${in_folder}` will always work, but if `in_folder` does not exist, it will fail.
- It lacks proper validation to check whether input and output directories exist.

#### **2. Efficiency Issues**
- Using `ls | wc -l` to count files is **not reliable** (e.g., it counts hidden files).
- `cat "${FILEPATH}" | while read x` is **useless use of `cat`** and can be replaced with `while read x < "${FILEPATH}"`.

#### **3. Hardcoded Assumptions**
- `awk -F "_" '{print ">" $2}'` assumes that the second field is the species name. If the naming convention changes, it will break.
- The script doesn't create `OUTPUT_DIR` if it doesn't exist.

    local output_dir=${2%/}

    echo "Input Directory: $input_dir"
    echo "Output Directory: $output_dir"

    local nu_of_files
    nu_of_files=$(get_number_of_files_to_rename "$input_dir")

    rename_fasta_files "$input_dir" "$output_dir" "$nu_of_files"
}

### **Key Improvements**
âœ… **Error Handling**
- Checks if directories exist before proceeding.
- Warns about missing files instead of breaking the script.

âœ… **Efficiency**
- Uses `find` instead of `ls` for counting files.
- Eliminates unnecessary `cat` calls.
- Uses `while read -r` properly to avoid issues with special characters.

âœ… **Portability**
- Works in different shells and avoids unnecessary variable substitutions (`${INPUT_DIR//\//}` was removed).
- Ensures that `OUTPUT_DIR` exists before writing files.

Would you like any additional features, such as custom file naming? ðŸš€


> for q1trees.sh 

### **General Feedback**
Your script effectively generates phylogenetic trees for multiple alignments using `iqtree2`. However, there are several **issues and limitations**:

### **Issues & Improvements**

#### **1. Hardcoded Input Directory in `get_number_of_trees`**
- The function always processes `prouts` instead of using the provided `input_dir`.
- If `prouts` is not the intended directory, the script might behave unexpectedly.

#### **2. Inefficient & Error-Prone File Counting**
- `ls | wc -l` is **not reliable** (it counts hidden files and directories).
- Using `find` with a file filter (e.g., `*.fa`) is **more accurate**.

#### **3. Unnecessary `|| true` in `iqtree2` Command**
- `|| true` forces the script to ignore errors, making debugging difficult.
- If `iqtree2` fails, you may not realize something is wrong.

#### **4. Improper Variable Scope**
- `nu_of_trees` is not explicitly returned, causing potential unintended behavior.

#### **5. Potential Issues with Directory Handling**
- The script does not check if `input_dir` exists before running.
- It assumes all files are named `outputN.fa`, which may not always be true.

## **Alternative Code with Fixes**
```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

echo "This script creates phylogenetic trees for all alignments in a folder."

set -e  # Exit on error

# Function to count alignment files
get_number_of_trees() {
    local in_folder=$1

    if [[ ! -d "$in_folder" ]]; then
        echo "Error: Input directory '$in_folder' does not exist." >&2
        exit 1
    fi

    local nu_of_trees=$(find "$in_folder" -maxdepth 1 -type f -name "output*.fa" | wc -l)
    echo "I will produce trees for $nu_of_trees alignments."
    echo "$nu_of_trees"  # Return the count
}

# Function to generate phylogenetic trees
treemaker() {
    local input_dir=$1
    local output_dir=$2
    local nu_of_trees=$3

    mkdir -p "$output_dir"  # Ensure output directory exists

    for ((i = 1; i <= nu_of_trees; i++)); do
        local file_path="$input_dir/output${i}.fa"

        if [[ ! -f "$file_path" ]]; then
            echo "Warning: File '$file_path' not found, skipping." >&2
            continue
        fi

        local exon_to_process
        exon_to_process=$(head -n1 "$file_path" | awk -F "_" '{print $1 "_" $3}')
        echo "Processing: $exon_to_process"

        iqtree2 -s "$file_path" -redo -pre "$output_dir/tree${i}" 
    done
}

# Main function
main() {
    local input_dir=${1%/}  # Remove trailing slashes
    local output_dir=${2%/}

    echo "Input Directory: $input_dir"
    echo "Output Directory: $output_dir"

    local nu_of_trees
    nu_of_trees=$(get_number_of_trees "$input_dir")

    treemaker "$input_dir" "$output_dir" "$nu_of_trees"
}

main "$@"
```

## **Key Improvements**
âœ… **Fixed Hardcoded Input Directory**  
- Now `get_number_of_trees` properly counts files in `input_dir`, not `"prouts"`.

âœ… **Reliable File Counting**
- Uses `find "$input_dir" -maxdepth 1 -type f -name "output*.fa" | wc -l` to **avoid counting hidden files**.

âœ… **Proper Error Handling**
- Checks if directories and files exist before proceeding.
- Removes `|| true` in `iqtree2` to **catch errors instead of ignoring them**.

âœ… **More Robust Variable Handling**
- Variables are **properly returned and passed** between functions.
- Uses `"${1%/}"` to remove trailing slashes from input/output directory names.

âœ… **More Portable**
- `mkdir -p "$output_dir"` ensures the directory exists without redundant `if` checks.

### **Would you like to add any extra functionality?**  
For example:  
- Parallel execution of `iqtree2` (to speed up processing).  
- Logging execution times for each tree. ðŸš€:w
