In how to run I have written all the commands I used to execute my scripts.

In Report dir there is a .txt with answers for the task given by Jasons' Introduction_to_Linux_Assignment. 

I have included the config file where I have the input parameters for my mainscript.sh that splits the compressed file. 
In env folder I have writtern the document with the dependencied needed to be included in the dockerfile.

In order to run I had save the input data in this path: "<pwd>/input_data/exonNuc.fa.gz
